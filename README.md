# TaylorSeries.jl

A julia package for Taylor expansions in one independent variable.


### An overlook

This package computes Taylor expansions (around 0) using automatic differentiation techniques (see e.g. Alex Haro's [nice paper][1]). The module implements the basic operations (+,-,*,/,^), some elementary functions (exp, log, sin, cos, tan), integration, differentiation and (a Horner's rule) evaluation on a point. 

The basic constructors for the Taylor type are:

- `Taylor{T<:Number}(a::Taylor{T}, order::Integer)`
- `Taylor{T<:Number}(a::Array{T,1}, order::Integer)` 
- `Taylor{T<:Number}(a::T, order::Integer)`

Taylor polynomials can be constructed from its coefficients (increasing with the order of the polynomial), which may be of type Taylor, a vector or even a number (`<:Number`). The order of the polynomial can be omitted, which is then guessed from the length of the coefficients (otherwise it is the `max` among the length of the coefficients or the integer specified). 

By default, the Taylor expansions are implemented around 0; if the expansion around a different value $x_0$ is needed, the trick is $x\to x+a$; see the definition of `x(x0)` below.

The usual arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`, `==`) have been extended to work with the Taylor type, including combinations of polynomials and scalars.

Some elemental functions have been implemented using automatic differentiation techniques, i.e., by computing recursively their coefficients. These are: `exp`, `log`, `square`, `sqrt`, `sin`, `cos` and `tan`; more functions will be added in the future.
```julia
julia> exp( -x0 )

```

Differentiating and integrating is trivial for polynomial expansions. The last coefficient of the differential is set to zero; for the integral, the integration constant may be set to a different value (the default is zero). The order of the resulting polynomial is not changed. The n-th ($n\ge 0$) derivative is obtained with `deriv(a,n)`, where `a` is a Taylor series; default is n=1.

```julia
julia> diffTaylor(exp(x0))
Taylor{Float64}([1.0,1.0,0.5,0.166667,0.0416667,0.0],5)

julia> integTaylor(exp(x0))
Taylor{Float64}([0.0,1.0,0.5,0.166667,0.0416667,0.00833333],5)

julia> integTaylor( exp(x0), 1.0)
Taylor{Float64}([1.0,1.0,0.5,0.166667,0.0416667,0.00833333],5)

julia> integTaylor( diffTaylor( exp(-x0)), 1.0 ) == exp(-x0)
true

julia> deriv( exp(x(1.0))) == e
true

julia> deriv( exp(x(1.0)), 5) == e
true
```

For the evaluation of a Taylor series, we use Horner's rule and `evalTaylor(a::Taylor, dx::Number)`. Here, $dx$ is the difference with respect to the point $x_0$ where the Taylor expansion was calculated, i.e., the series is evaluated at $x = x_0 + dx$. Omitting $dx$ corresponds to $dx=0$.

```julia
julia> evalTaylor( exp( x(1.0) )) - e ## exp(x) around x0=1 (order 5), evaluated there (dx=0)
0.0

julia> evalTaylor( exp(x0), 1) - e    ## exp(x) around x0=0 (order 5), evaluated at x=1
-0.0016151617923783057

julia> evalTaylor( exp( Taylor(x0, 17) ), 1) - e  ## exp(x) around x0=0 (order 17), evaluated at x=1
0.0

julia> evalTaylor( exp( Taylor([0,BigFloat("1.0")],50) ), BigFloat("1.0") )

```

In order to get a *compact* and more readable display, we have modified `showcompact`.
```julia
julia> showcompact( x0 )
5-order Taylor{Float64}:
  1.0 * x 

julia> exp(xI)
Taylor{Complex{Float64}}(Complex{Float64}[1.0+0.0im,0.0+1.0im,-0.5+0.0im,0.0-0.166667im,0.0416667+0.0im,0.0+0.00833333im],5)

julia> showcompact( exp(xI) )
5-order Taylor{Complex{Float64}}

julia> print( exp(xI) )
Taylor{Complex{Float64}}(Complex{Float64}[1.0 + 0.0im,0.0 + 1.0im,-0.5 + 0.0im,0.0 - 0.16666666666666666im,0.041666666666666664 + 0.0im,0.0 + 0.008333333333333333im],5)

julia> convert(Taylor{Rational{Int64}}, exp(x0))
Taylor{Rational{Int64}}(Rational{Int64}[1//1,1//1,1//2,1//6,1//24,1//120],5)

julia> showcompact(ans)
5-order Taylor{Rational{Int64}}:
  1//1  + 1//1 * x + 1//2 * x^2 + 1//6 * x^3 + 1//24 * x^4 + 1//120 * x^5 

```

It is worth pointing out the existing julia packages [Polynomial][2] and [PowerSeries][3], which have similar functionality as this one, but somewhat different approaches.

Comments on the code are appreciated.
